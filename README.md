# 🧠 Mental Health in Tech Survey – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview

Mental health has become an increasingly important topic in today’s fast-paced
and high-pressure technology industry. This project performs an **Exploratory
Data Analysis (EDA)** on the **Mental Health in Tech Survey (2014)** to understand
how mental health is perceived, discussed, and supported within tech
workplaces.

The analysis focuses on employee awareness, stigma, organizational policies,
and factors influencing mental health treatment-seeking behavior. The goal is
to extract actionable insights that can help organizations build healthier,
more supportive, and productive work environments.
